Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for
creating word clouds and other types of word analysis.
And itâ€™s more useful when running it against lots of text.
Create a program that reads in a file named `exercise46_input.txt` and
counts the frequency of words in the file.
Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to the screen.
Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report and the least used words are at the bottom.
