 Programming languages can create files and folders too.
 Create a program that generates a website skeleton with the following specifications:

 Prompt for the name of the site.
 Prompt for the author of the site.
 Ask if the user wants a folder for JavaScript files.
 Ask if the user wants a folder for CSS files.
 Generate an index.html file that contains the name of the site inside the <title> tag and the author in a <meta> tag.
 The user should then find these files and directories created in the working directory of your program.
