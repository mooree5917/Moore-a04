 Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes parsing much simpler.
 Many programming languages support the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.
 Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product.
 The product data is in a data file in the JSON format  and looks like this
 (you will create this file as `exercise44_input.json`):
 Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found.
 If no product matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.
 The file is in the JSON format. Use a JSON parser to pull the values out of the file
 (e.g. https://github.com/google/gson (Links to an external site.)).
 If no record is found, prompt again.
